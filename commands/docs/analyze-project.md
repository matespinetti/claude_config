# /analyze-project

Analyze an existing codebase and generate INITIAL.md template for integrating Context Engineering workflow.

## Execution Flow

1. **Read CLAUDE.md**
   - Access universal development rules from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
   - Understand established patterns and conventions
   - Check quality standards and testing requirements

2. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Scan project structure and identify main components
   - Detect programming language, frameworks, and libraries
   - Analyze existing patterns, architecture, and design decisions
   - Identify entry points, main modules, and key functionality

3. **Feature Discovery**
   - Map existing functionality and features
   - Identify models, routes, services, and utilities
   - Understand data flow and component relationships
   - Detect authentication, authorization, and security patterns

4. **Documentation Generation**
   - Create comprehensive INITIAL.md template
   - Document current functionality as baseline
   - Suggest logical next features based on existing code
   - Provide architecture overview and improvement opportunities

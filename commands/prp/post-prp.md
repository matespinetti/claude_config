# /post-prp

Clean up and validate after execute-prp implementation, ensuring CLAUDE.md compliance and preparing for commit.

## Execution Flow

1. **Read CLAUDE.md**
   - Understand project standards and validation requirements
   - Check established patterns and conventions
   - Identify validation tools and testing frameworks
   - Review quality gates and compliance rules

2. **Implementation Validation**
   - Verify all PRP requirements were implemented correctly
   - Check that new features match original specifications
   - Ensure acceptance criteria from INITIAL.md are met
   - Validate no functionality was missed or incorrectly implemented

3. **CLAUDE.md Compliance Check**
   - Scan all modified/new files for 500-line limit compliance
   - Verify consistent naming conventions are followed
   - Check that modular architecture patterns are maintained
   - Ensure proper file organization and structure

4. **Code Quality Validation**
   - Run project's linter and formatter on all changed files
   - Execute type checking if project uses type annotations
   - Check for syntax errors and compilation issues
   - Validate import statements and dependencies

5. **Test Suite Validation**
   - Verify tests exist for all new functionality (expected use, edge case, failure scenario)
   - Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
   - Check test coverage meets project standards
   - Validate test files follow established patterns in /tests folder

6. **Documentation Verification**
   - Ensure new functions have proper documentation comments
   - Check complex logic has "# Reason:" explanations
   - Verify README.md updates if significant features added
   - Validate API documentation reflects changes

7. **Security and Best Practices**
   - Scan for hardcoded secrets or credentials
   - Check for common security vulnerabilities
   - Validate environment variable usage
   - Ensure error handling follows project patterns

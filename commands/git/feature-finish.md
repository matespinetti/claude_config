description: Complete feature development with professional workflow
---

Please help me complete this feature professionally:

1. **Feature Review**:
   - `git log --oneline` to review all commits for this feature
   - Verify feature works completely end-to-end
   - Check that all planned functionality is implemented

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Run full test suite: `npm test` (or project equivalent)
   - Execute linting: `npm run lint` (or project equivalent)
   - Check for any TODO comments or debug code
   - Verify no console.log or temporary code remains

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update CLAUDE.md with new feature details
   - Update README if user-facing changes
   - Ensure API documentation reflects changes
   - Update any relevant changelogs

4. **Commit History Review**:
   - Are commit messages clear and professional?
   - Do commits represent logical working units?
   - Is there any cleanup needed (squashing, etc.)?

5. **Merge Strategy Recommendation**:
   Based on commit history and team practices:
   - **Squash Merge**: If feature is better as single logical unit
   - **Merge Commit**: If multiple logical commits should be preserved
   - **Rebase**: If linear history is preferred

6. **Pull Request Preparation**:
   - Generate PR title: Clear, descriptive summary
   - Create PR description with:
     * What was implemented
     * How to test the feature
     * Any breaking changes or dependencies
     * Screenshots/examples if relevant
   - Suggest reviewers based on code areas touched

7. **Final Steps**:
   - Push any final changes: `git push origin feature/[branch-name]`
   - Provide git command for creating PR or merge
   - Suggest any deployment considerations

Ready the feature for professional team review and integration.

Please bootstrap this project by:

1. **Git Repository Check**: 
   - Check if this is a git repository (`git status`)
   - If not initialized, ask if I want to set up git
   - Check current branch and suggest develop branch setup if needed

2. **Auto-Discovery**: Analyze this project and determine:
   - Project type (web app, library, CLI, mobile, etc.)
   - Technology stack (languages, frameworks, tools)
   - Architecture patterns and conventions
   - Testing approach and tools
   - Build/deployment setup

3. **Context Creation**: Generate a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - Technology stack and dependencies
   - Architecture and key patterns
   - Development workflow and conventions
   - Git workflow preferences (feature branch, develop branch, etc.)
   - Important files and directories
   - Testing and quality standards

4. **Git Best Practices Setup**: Recommend:
   - Appropriate .gitignore for this project type
   - Branch strategy (main/develop/feature branches)
   - Commit message conventions
   - Merge strategies for this team/project

5. **Development Guidance**: Explain:
   - How to run/build this project
   - How testing works here
   - What the development workflow should be

Make this project-specific and actionable. Adapt your advice to the actual technology and patterns you find.

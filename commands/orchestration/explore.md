description: Intelligently explore any codebase or component
---

Target to explore: $ARGUMENTS

Please explore this intelligently by:

1. **Context Detection**: Understand what type of code/component this is
2. **Purpose Analysis**: What does this do and why does it exist?
3. **Dependencies**: What does it depend on? What depends on it?
4. **Patterns**: What patterns, conventions, or architecture is used?
5. **Key Insights**: What are the most important things to understand?
6. **Entry Points**: How do I interact with or use this?

Adapt your exploration approach based on what you're looking at (API, UI component, database schema, etc.).
